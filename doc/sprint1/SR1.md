# 🚧 Unfinished Tasks

## 👨 Bart
- 🔊 I want an option for the website to play a sound cue when a new quote is given, so I know when something has changed.  
- 🕒 I want the option to display additional information such as the date and time alongside the quote.  
- 🤖 I want to get AI-generated quotes based on my prompt.  
- ✨ Enable/Disable Floating Animation.  

## 👩 Diana
- 🔄 I want to be able to choose how quotes are cycled – whether it is a hard change, fade, or another type of transition.  
- 🖼️ I want quotes to be accompanied by a relaxing or visually pleasing image, something nice to accompany the quote.  
- 🔁 I want to avoid seeing the same quotes multiple times in a short span of time, so every time I receive a new quote, I get to see something new and fresh.  
- 🔐 I want to log in using the credentials I signed up with.  

# Next Sprint

## Continued Practices
- Team communication through mediums such as Discord and Trello was fantastic throughout this first sprint. It allowed us to communicate effectively and work well together even though we were not in person.

## New Practices
- One of the biggest problems we ran into was with our documentation as the grand majority of it was written at the end of the sprint. Our mindset of code first and document later will have to change and we will instead choose to document important information as we go along to prevent backtracking and ensure that no important information is forgotten.
- We should also make use of the branch feature more. While we did do this in the first sprint we did not take advantage of it nearly enough which has led to many errors in our code, especially when it has come to parallel programming. 

# Review of Sprint 1

## Harmful Practices
- As listed above, our tendency to leave documentation to the end and not branch out enough was very harmful. While the former has only led to an increase in tedium, the latter has caused errors in our code as two people attempt to merge work at the same time.

## Best Work Experience
- We have worked together very well as a team. Our sprint meetings have gone well, we are efficient at getting our jobs done, and we have done a fantastic job when it comes to jumping in and helping each other out.

## Worst Work Experience
- The only poor experience that came from this sprint happened due to lack of branching. Trying to troubleshoot conflicting code was very difficult and led to many errors within our program.
