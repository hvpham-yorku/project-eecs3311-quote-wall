## Focused User Stories  

### Diana  
- I recommend this website to all sorts of people. I want an easy-to-use design that anyone can pick up and understand. 
- Buttons and menus should clearly indicate their purpose and be designed intuitively.  
- I want to be able to choose between a **light and dark mode** for the user interface, to better suit different lighting environments.  
- The design and UI should be **unobtrusive and non-distracting**; the website's purpose is to add inspiration, not to take up too much time.  
- I want the option to **add new interests** or **edit my existing preferences**.  
- I want to **control how often** I see new quotes so that the content feels dynamic.  
- My preferences and interests should be **stored persistently**, so I don’t need to reconfigure them every time I log in.  

### Bart  
- When glancing at the website, I don't want to be distracted by buttons or unnecessary text. I want a toggle for menu or UI elements so the main focus can be on the quote. 
- I want the quotes to be **tailored to my interests**, covering a broad range of people and topics I know.  
- I want **customization options** for content display, including **text size and positioning**.  
- I want the option to **show additional information**, such as the **date and time** alongside the quote.  
- My preferences should be **transferable between devices** (e.g., home and work laptop).  
- I want to **create an account** to sign in from any device and retain access to my preferences and interests.  
- My **username and password should be unique**, and my information should be **securely stored** so that only I have access to my preferences.
