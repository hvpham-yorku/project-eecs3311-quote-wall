## 🎯 Focused User Stories  

### **👩 Diana**  
- ⭐ I recommend this website to all sorts of people. I want an **easy-to-use design** that anyone can pick up and understand.

- 🌗 I want to be able to choose between a **light and dark mode** for better viewing in different lighting conditions.  
- 🎯 The UI should be **unobtrusive and non-distracting**; the website's purpose is to add inspiration, not take up too much time.  
- ⚙️ I want the option to **add new interests** or **edit my existing preferences**.  
- 🔄 I want to **control how often** I see new quotes so the content feels dynamic.
