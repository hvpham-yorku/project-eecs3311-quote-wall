# Review of Sprint 2

## Improvements from Sprint 1
- We used branches much better this time, keeping work from different areas separated in different, regularly updated branches so reduce the number of merge errors we recieved.

## Harmful Practices
- There were a few instances where we pushed code to main in an effort to keep code up to date, without necessarily checking that the code we were pushing was 100% complete or stable. This created problems on a few occassions.
  
## Best Work Experience
- Our communication was good, using discord well to organize ourselves and keep our work in sync. When all the pieces were complete, this made it very quick and easy to put everything together in the end.

## Worst Work Experience
- We frequently encountered problems with our database hosting platform "SupaBase" experiencing issues, where we could not access our database for hours at a time for reasons beyond our control.
